# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ã€lex FernÃ¡ndez (@tomaquet18)

I'm someone whoâ€™s always enjoyed understanding how things work â€” and more importantly, how they break.

Over time, that curiosity naturally led me into the world of **cybersecurity**, especially the offensive side. I spend most of my time digging into systems, automating everything I can, and building tools that help me go deeper and faster.

What I love the most? Finding creative ways to chain vulnerabilities, scripting my own recon pipelines, and turning chaotic data into something actionable. I enjoy the process just as much as the result.

I work on private projects focused on **automated reconnaissance**, and I constantly experiment with ways to improve efficiency in **bug bounty workflows**. If something feels repetitive, I probably already wrote a script for it.

Aside from that, I enjoy building clean and purposeful UIs to visualize security data, even if itâ€™s just for my own use.

## ðŸ§  What drives me

- Learning by breaking things
- Automating boring stuff
- Designing tools that simplify complex tasks
- Constantly refining my own workflow
